# hello-world
Entry repository
It's about time I joined up on Github. I've heard about it for quite some time but haven't committed myself to it (see what I did there? Haha). Anyway, mostly Python and whatever else looks fascinating. It's been some time since I have last attempted anything in Python, but hopefully that will change because I want the experience. First project will be creating a simple staircase pattern with the # symbol. Should be easy enough.
